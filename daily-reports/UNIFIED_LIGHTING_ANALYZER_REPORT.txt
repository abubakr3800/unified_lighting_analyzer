                                LIGHTING STANDARDS
================================================================================

WHAT ARE LIGHTING STANDARDS?

Lighting standards are established guidelines and requirements that define the 
minimum acceptable levels of lighting quality, energy efficiency, and visual 
comfort for different types of spaces and activities. These standards ensure 
that lighting installations meet safety, productivity, and environmental 
requirements while providing optimal visual conditions for users.

SUPPORTED STANDARDS:

1. EN 12464-1:2021 - Light and lighting - Lighting of work places
   - European standard for workplace lighting
   - Defines illuminance levels, uniformity ratios, glare limits
   - Covers various room types: offices, meeting rooms, corridors, storage, industrial
   - Requirements include:
     * Illuminance minimums (100-500 lux depending on room type)
     * Uniformity ratios (0.4-0.6 minimum)
     * UGR limits (19-25 maximum)
     * Power density limits (5-15 W/m²)
     * Color temperature (3000-6500K)
     * CRI minimum (80)

2. BREEAM - Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method
   - UK-based environmental assessment method
   - Focuses on sustainability and energy efficiency
   - Stricter requirements than EN 12464-1
   - Requirements include:
     * Higher uniformity ratios (0.7 minimum)
     * Lower power density limits (10 W/m² maximum)
     * Enhanced energy efficiency criteria

HOW TO USE STANDARDS:

1. AUTOMATIC STANDARDS MAPPING:
   - System automatically maps room types to appropriate standards
   - Room types: office, meeting_room, conference_room, corridor, storage, 
     industrial, retail, educational, healthcare, residential, outdoor
   - Each room type has specific requirements for each standard

2. COMPLIANCE CHECKING PROCESS:
   - Extract lighting parameters from PDF reports
   - Compare actual values against standard requirements
   - Calculate compliance rates and deviations
   - Generate detailed compliance reports
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvements

3. STANDARDS DATABASE STRUCTURE:
   - JSON-based standards database (data/standards_db.json)
   - Hierarchical structure: Standard -> Room Type -> Parameters
   - Easily extensible for new standards and room types
   - Version-controlled for standard updates
