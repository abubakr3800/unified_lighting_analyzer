- We will coordinate the public disclosure after the fix is released
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## üîê Security Considerations

### File Processing Security

The application processes PDF files uploaded by users. Consider the following:

#### PDF Security Risks
- **Malicious PDFs**: PDFs can contain embedded scripts, malware, or exploit code
- **Large files**: Large PDFs can cause memory exhaustion or DoS attacks
- **File format attacks**: Malformed PDFs can cause crashes or unexpected behavior

#### Mitigation Measures
- **File size limits**: Implement reasonable file size restrictions
- **File type validation**: Verify file headers and structure
- **Sandboxed processing**: Process files in isolated environments when possible
- **Input sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all extracted data

### API Key Security

The application uses OpenAI API keys for enhanced analysis:

#### API Key Risks
- **Exposure**: API keys can be exposed in logs, error messages, or client-side code
- **Unauthorized usage**: Stolen keys can be used for unauthorized API calls
- **Cost implications**: Misuse can result in unexpected charges

#### Best Practices
- **Environment variables**: Store API keys in environment variables, not in code
- **Key rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys
- **Usage monitoring**: Monitor API usage for unusual patterns
- **Access control**: Limit API key permissions to minimum required

### Web Interface Security

The Streamlit web interface has specific security considerations:

#### Web Security Risks
- **Session management**: Insecure session handling
- **File uploads**: Malicious file uploads
- **XSS attacks**: Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
- **CSRF attacks**: Cross-site request forgery

#### Security Measures
- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **File upload restrictions**: Limit file types and sizes
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production environments
- **Session security**: Implement secure session management

### Data Privacy

The application processes potentially sensitive lighting data:

#### Privacy Considerations
- **Data storage**: Where and how data is stored
- **Data transmission**: How data is transmitted between components
- **Data retention**: How long data is kept
- **Data sharing**: Whether data is shared with third parties

#### Privacy Measures
- **Local processing**: Process data locally when possible
- **Data encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Data minimization**: Only collect and process necessary data
- **User consent**: Obtain clear consent for data processing

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Secure configuration using environment variables:

```bash
# API Keys (keep secure)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-secure-api-key"

# Security settings
export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-for-sessions"
export ALLOWED_HOSTS="localhost,127.0.0.1"

# File processing limits
export MAX_FILE_SIZE="50MB"
export MAX_PROCESSING_TIME="300"

# Logging (avoid sensitive data)
export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
export LOG_SENSITIVE_DATA="false"
```

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] **API keys secured** in environment variables
- [ ] **File upload limits** configured appropriately
- [ ] **Input validation** implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] **Error handling** doesn't expose sensitive information
- [ ] **Logging configured** to avoid sensitive data exposure
- [ ] **Dependencies updated** to latest secure versions
- [ ] **Access controls** implemented for sensitive operations
- [ ] **Backup and recovery** procedures in place
- [ ] **Monitoring and alerting** configured for security events

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   ```python
   # Validate file types
   ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'.pdf'}
   
   def validate_file(file_path):
       if not file_path.suffix.lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS:
           raise ValueError("Invalid file type")
   ```

2. **Secure API Key Handling**
   ```python
   import os
   
   # Never hardcode API keys
   api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
   if not api_key:
       raise ValueError("API key not configured")
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   ```python
   try:
       result = process_file(file_path)
   except Exception as e:
       # Log error details internally
       logger.error(f"Processing failed: {e}")
       # Return generic error to user
       raise ProcessingError("File processing failed")
   ```

4. **File Size Limits**
   ```python
   MAX_FILE_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # 50MB
   
   def validate_file_size(file_path):
       if file_path.stat().st_size > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
           raise ValueError("File too large")
   ```

### For Users

1. **API Key Security**
   - Never share your OpenAI API key
   - Use environment variables to store keys
   - Monitor your API usage regularly
   - Rotate keys periodically

2. **File Security**
   - Only upload PDFs from trusted sources
   - Scan files with antivirus software
   - Avoid uploading files with sensitive information
   - Use the application in a secure environment

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS when accessing the web interface
   - Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive operations
   - Keep your system and browser updated
   - Use strong, unique passwords

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Logging Security Events

```python
import logging

# Configure security logging
security_logger = logging.getLogger('security')

def log_security_event(event_type, details):
    security_logger.warning(f"Security event: {event_type} - {details}")

# Example usage
log_security_event("FILE_UPLOAD", f"Large file uploaded: {file_size}")
log_security_event("API_KEY_USAGE", f"API key used for analysis: {user_id}")
```

### Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] **File upload monitoring**: Track file sizes and types
- [ ] **API usage monitoring**: Monitor API key usage patterns
- [ ] **Error rate monitoring**: Track unusual error patterns
- [ ] **Performance monitoring**: Monitor for DoS indicators
- [ ] **Access monitoring**: Track user access patterns
